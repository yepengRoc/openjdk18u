/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} that executes each submitted task using
 * one of possibly several pooled threads, normally configured
 * using {@link Executors} factory methods.
 *一个ExecutorService，它使用可能是多个池线程中的一个来执行每个提交的任务，通常使用Executors工厂方法进行配置。
 * <p>Thread pools address two different problems: they usually
 * provide improved performance when executing large numbers of
 * asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation overhead,
 * and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources,
 * including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks.
 * Each {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} also maintains some basic
 * statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.
 * 线程池解决了两个不同的问题：由于减少了每个任务的调用开销，它们通常在执行大量异步任务时可提供改进的性能，
 * 并且它们提供了一种绑定和管理资源（包括线程）的方法，该资源在执行集合的执行时消耗任务。
 * 每个ThreadPoolExecutor还维护一些基本统计信息，例如已完成任务的数量。
 * <p>To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class
 * provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility
 * hooks. However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient
 * {@link Executors} factory methods {@link
 * Executors#newCachedThreadPool} (unbounded thread pool, with
 * automatic thread reclamation), {@link Executors#newFixedThreadPool}
 * (fixed size thread pool) and {@link
 * Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor} (single background thread), that
 * preconfigure settings for the most common usage
 * scenarios. Otherwise, use the following guide when manually
 * configuring and tuning this class:
 * 为了在广泛的上下文中有用，此类提供了许多可调整的参数和可扩展性挂钩。
 * 但是，建议程序员使用更方便的Executors工厂方法Executors.newCachedThreadPool（）（无边界线程池，具有自动线程回收），
 * Executors.newFixedThreadPool（int）（固定大小的线程池）和Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor（）（单个背景）线程），
 * 可以针对最常见的使用情况预先配置设置。否则，在手动配置和调整此类时，请使用以下指南：
 * <dl>
 *
 * <dt>Core and maximum pool sizes</dt>核心和最大池大小
 *
 * <dd>A {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} will automatically adjust the
 * pool size (see {@link #getPoolSize})
 * according to the bounds set by
 * corePoolSize (see {@link #getCorePoolSize}) and
 * maximumPoolSize (see {@link #getMaximumPoolSize}).
 * ThreadPoolExecutor将根据corePoolSize（请参见getCorePoolSize（））和maximumPoolSize（请参见getMaximumPoolSize（））
 *   设置的边界自动调整池大小（请参见getPoolSize（））。
 *
 * When a new task is submitted in method {@link #execute(Runnable)},
 * and fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, a new thread is
 * created to handle the request, even if other worker threads are
 * idle.  If there are more than corePoolSize but less than
 * maximumPoolSize threads running, a new thread will be created only
 * if the queue is full.  By setting corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize
 * the same, you create a fixed-size thread pool. By setting
 * maximumPoolSize to an essentially unbounded value such as {@code
 * Integer.MAX_VALUE}, you allow the pool to accommodate an arbitrary
 * number of concurrent tasks. Most typically, core and maximum pool
 * sizes are set only upon construction, but they may also be changed
 * dynamically using {@link #setCorePoolSize} and {@link
 * #setMaximumPoolSize}. </dd>
 * 当在方法execute（Runnable）中提交新任务，并且正在运行的线程少于corePoolSize线程时，
 * 即使其他工作线程处于空闲状态，也会创建一个新线程来处理请求。如果运行的线程数大于corePoolSize但小于maximumPoolSize，
 * 则仅在队列已满时才创建新线程。通过将corePoolSize和maximumPoolSize设置为相同，可以创建固定大小的线程池。
 * 通过将maximumPoolSize设置为一个本质上不受限制的值（例如Integer.MAX_VALUE），可以允许池容纳任意数量的并发任务。
 * 最典型地，核心和最大池大小仅在构造时设置，但也可以使用setCorePoolSize（int）和setMaximumPoolSize（int）动态更改。
 * <dt>On-demand construction</dt>按需施工
 *
 * <dd>By default, even core threads are initially created and
 * started only when new tasks arrive, but this can be overridden
 * dynamically using method {@link #prestartCoreThread} or {@link
 * #prestartAllCoreThreads}.  You probably want to prestart threads if
 * you construct the pool with a non-empty queue. </dd>
 * 默认情况下，甚至只有在有新任务到达时才开始甚至启动核心线程，但是可以使用prestartCoreThread（）
 * 或prestartAllCoreThreads（）方法动态地覆盖它。如果使用非空队列构造池，则可能要预启动线程。
 * <dt>Creating new threads</dt>创建新线程
 *
 * <dd>New threads are created using a {@link ThreadFactory}.  If not
 * otherwise specified, a {@link Executors#defaultThreadFactory} is
 * used, that creates threads to all be in the same {@link
 * ThreadGroup} and with the same {@code NORM_PRIORITY} priority and
 * non-daemon status. By supplying a different ThreadFactory, you can
 * alter the thread's name, thread group, priority, daemon status,
 * etc. If a {@code ThreadFactory} fails to create a thread when asked
 * by returning null from {@code newThread}, the executor will
 * continue, but might not be able to execute any tasks. Threads
 * should possess the "modifyThread" {@code RuntimePermission}. If
 * worker threads or other threads using the pool do not possess this
 * permission, service may be degraded: configuration changes may not
 * take effect in a timely manner, and a shutdown pool may remain in a
 * state in which termination is possible but not completed.</dd>
 * 使用ThreadFactory创建新线程。如果未另行指定，则使用Executors.defaultThreadFactory（），
 * 该线程将创建全部位于同一ThreadGroup中且具有相同NORM_PRIORITY优先级和非守护程序状态的线程。
 * 通过提供不同的ThreadFactory，可以更改线程的名称，线程组，优先级，守护程序状态等。
 * 如果ThreadFactory在通过从newThread返回null 返回要求时未能创建线程，执行器将继续执行，
 * 但可能无法执行执行任何任务。线程应具有“ modifyThread” RuntimePermission。如果使用该池的工作线程或其他线程不具有此权限，
 * 则服务可能会降级：配置更改可能不会及时生效，并且关闭池可能保持在可能终止但未完成的状态。
 * <dt>Keep-alive times</dt>
 *
 * <dd>If the pool currently has more than corePoolSize threads,
 * excess threads will be terminated if they have been idle for more
 * than the keepAliveTime (see {@link #getKeepAliveTime(TimeUnit)}).
 * This provides a means of reducing resource consumption when the
 * pool is not being actively used. If the pool becomes more active
 * later, new threads will be constructed. This parameter can also be
 * changed dynamically using method {@link #setKeepAliveTime(long,
 * TimeUnit)}.  Using a value of {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} {@link
 * TimeUnit#NANOSECONDS} effectively disables idle threads from ever
 * terminating prior to shut down. By default, the keep-alive policy
 * applies only when there are more than corePoolSize threads. But
 * method {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)} can be used to
 * apply this time-out policy to core threads as well, so long as the
 * keepAliveTime value is non-zero. </dd>
 * 如果当前池中的线程数超过corePoolSize，则多余的线程将在空闲时间超过keepAliveTime时终止（请参阅getKeepAliveTime（TimeUnit））。
 * 当未积极使用池时，这提供了减少资源消耗的方法。如果池稍后变得更加活动，则将构建新线程。也可以使用setKeepAliveTime（long，TimeUnit）方法动态更改此参数。
 * 使用Long.MAX_VALUE TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS的值可以有效地使空闲线程永远不会在关闭之前终止。默认情况下，仅当存在多个corePoolSize线程时，
 * 保持活动策略才适用。但是，只要keepAliveTime值不为零，方法allowCoreThreadTimeOut（boolean）也可以用于将此超时策略应用于核心线程。
 * <dt>Queuing</dt>
 *
 * <dd>Any {@link BlockingQueue} may be used to transfer and hold
 * submitted tasks.  The use of this queue interacts with pool sizing:
 * 任何BlockingQueue均可用于传输和保留提交的任务。此队列的使用与池大小交互：
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li> If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor
 * always prefers adding a new thread
 * rather than queuing.</li>
 * 如果运行的线程数少于corePoolSize，则执行程序总是喜欢添加新线程，而不是排队
 * <li> If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor
 * always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new
 * thread.</li>
 * 如果corePoolSize或更多线程正在运行，则执行程序总是更喜欢对请求进行排队，而不是添加新线程
 * <li> If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless
 * this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be
 * rejected.</li>
 * 如果无法将请求放入队列中，则将创建一个新线程，除非该线程超过了maximumPoolSize，在这种情况下，该任务将被拒绝
 * </ul>
 *
 * There are three general strategies for queuing:有三种一般的排队策略：
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li> <em> Direct handoffs.</em> A good default choice for a work
 * queue is a {@link SynchronousQueue} that hands off tasks to threads
 * without otherwise holding them. Here, an attempt to queue a task
 * will fail if no threads are immediately available to run it, so a
 * new thread will be constructed. This policy avoids lockups when
 * handling sets of requests that might have internal dependencies.
 * Direct handoffs generally require unbounded maximumPoolSizes to
 * avoid rejection of new submitted tasks. This in turn admits the
 * possibility of unbounded thread growth when commands continue to
 * arrive on average faster than they can be processed.  </li>
 * 直接交接。对于工作队列，一个很好的默认选择是SynchronousQueue，它可以将任务移交给线程，
 * 而不必另外保留它们。在这里，如果没有立即可用的线程来运行任务，则尝试将任务排队的尝试将失败，
 * 因此将构造一个新线程。在处理可能具有内部依赖性的请求集时，此策略避免了锁定。直接切换通常需要无限制的maximumPoolSizes，
 * 以避免拒绝新提交的任务。反过来，当平均而言，命令继续以比其处理速度更快的速度到达时，这可能会带来无限线程增长的可能性。
 *
 * <li><em> Unbounded queues.</em> Using an unbounded queue (for
 * example a {@link LinkedBlockingQueue} without a predefined
 * capacity) will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all
 * corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize
 * threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize
 * therefore doesn't have any effect.)  This may be appropriate when
 * each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot
 * affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server.
 * While this style of queuing can be useful in smoothing out
 * transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of
 * unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on
 * average faster than they can be processed.  </li>
 * 无限队列。使用无界队列（例如，没有预定义容量的LinkedBlockingQueue）将在所有corePoolSize线程繁忙时使新任务在队列中等待。
 * 因此，将只创建corePoolSize线程。（因此，maximumPoolSize的值没有任何作用。）当每个任务完全独立于其他任务时，这可能是适当的，
 * 因此任务不会影响彼此的执行。例如，在网页服务器中。尽管这种排队方式对于消除短暂的请求突发很有用，但是它承认当命令平均到达的速度比处理命令的速度快时，
 * 工作队列就会无限增长。
 *
 * <li><em>Bounded queues.</em> A bounded queue (for example, an
 * {@link ArrayBlockingQueue}) helps prevent resource exhaustion when
 * used with finite maximumPoolSizes, but can be more difficult to
 * tune and control.  Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes may be traded
 * off for each other: Using large queues and small pools minimizes
 * CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead, but can
 * lead to artificially low throughput.  If tasks frequently block (for
 * example if they are I/O bound), a system may be able to schedule
 * time for more threads than you otherwise allow. Use of small queues
 * generally requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but
 * may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead, which also
 * decreases throughput.  </li>
 * 有界队列。当与有限的maximumPoolSizes一起使用时，有界队列（例如ArrayBlockingQueue）有助于防止资源耗尽，
 * 但是调优和控制起来会更加困难。队列大小和最大池大小可能会相互折衷（相辅相成）：使用大队列和小池可最大程度地减少CPU使用率，
 * OS资源和上下文切换开销，但可能导致人为降低吞吐量。如果任务频繁阻塞（例如，如果它们受I / O限制），
 * 则系统可能能够安排比您原先允许的线程更多的时间。使用小队列通常需要更大的池大小，这会使CPU繁忙，
 * 但可能会遇到无法接受的调度开销，这也会降低吞吐量。
 * </ol>
 *
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Rejected tasks</dt>
 *
 * <dd>New tasks submitted in method {@link #execute(Runnable)} will be
 * <em>rejected</em> when the Executor has been shut down, and also when
 * the Executor uses finite bounds for both maximum threads and work queue
 * capacity, and is saturated.  In either case, the {@code execute} method
 * invokes the {@link
 * RejectedExecutionHandler#rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor)}
 * method of its {@link RejectedExecutionHandler}.  Four predefined handler
 * policies are provided:
 *  当执行器关闭时，并且在执行器对最大线程和工作队列容量使用有限范围时，
 *  执行器将关闭在方法execute（Runnable）中提交的新任务。无论哪种情况，
 *  execute方法都会调用其RejectedExecutionHandler的RejectedExecutionHandler.rejectedExecution（Runnable，ThreadPoolExecutor）方法。
 *  提供了四个预定义的处理程序策略：
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li> In the default {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy}, the
 * handler throws a runtime {@link RejectedExecutionException} upon
 * rejection. </li>
 * 在默认的ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy中，处理程序在拒绝时会抛出运行时RejectedExecutionException。
 * <li> In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy}, the thread
 * that invokes {@code execute} itself runs the task. This provides a
 * simple feedback control mechanism that will slow down the rate that
 * new tasks are submitted. </li>
 *  在ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy中，调用执行自己的线程运行任务。这提供了一种简单的反馈控制机制，将降低新任务提交的速度。
 *
 * <li> In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy}, a task that
 * cannot be executed is simply dropped.  </li>
 * 在ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy中，简单地删除了无法执行的任务。
 * <li>In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy}, if the
 * executor is not shut down, the task at the head of the work queue
 * is dropped, and then execution is retried (which can fail again,
 * causing this to be repeated.) </li>
 * 在ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy中，如果未关闭执行程序，则将丢弃工作队列开头的任务，然后重试执行（该操作可能再次失败，导致重复执行此操作）。
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * It is possible to define and use other kinds of {@link
 * RejectedExecutionHandler} classes. Doing so requires some care
 * especially when policies are designed to work only under particular
 * capacity or queuing policies. </dd>
 *  可以定义和使用其他种类的RejectedExecutionHandler类。这样做需要格外小心，尤其是在设计策略仅在特定容量或排队策略下工作时。
 *
 * <dt>Hook methods</dt>
 *
 * <dd>This class provides {@code protected} overridable
 * {@link #beforeExecute(Thread, Runnable)} and
 * {@link #afterExecute(Runnable, Throwable)} methods that are called
 * before and after execution of each task.  These can be used to
 * manipulate the execution environment; for example, reinitializing
 * ThreadLocals, gathering statistics, or adding log entries.
 * Additionally, method {@link #terminated} can be overridden to perform
 * any special processing that needs to be done once the Executor has
 * fully terminated.
 *  此类提供了受保护的可重写的beforeExecute（Thread，Runnable）和afterExecute（Runnable，Throwable）方法，
 *  这些方法在每个任务执行前后被调用。这些可以用来操纵执行环境。例如，重新初始化ThreadLocals，收集统计信息或添加日志条目。
 *  此外，一旦执行程序完全终止，可以覆盖方法Terminate（）以执行需要执行的任何特殊处理。
 *
 * <p>If hook or callback methods throw exceptions, internal worker
 * threads may in turn fail and abruptly terminate.</dd>
 * 如果钩子或回调方法引发异常，内部工作线程可能进而失败并突然终止。
 * <dt>Queue maintenance</dt>
 *
 * <dd>Method {@link #getQueue()} allows access to the work queue
 * for purposes of monitoring and debugging.  Use of this method for
 * any other purpose is strongly discouraged.  Two supplied methods,
 * {@link #remove(Runnable)} and {@link #purge} are available to
 * assist in storage reclamation when large numbers of queued tasks
 * become cancelled.</dd>
 * 方法getQueue（）允许访问工作队列，以进行监视和调试。强烈建议不要将此方法用于任何其他目的。
 * 当取消大量排队的任务时，可以使用提供的两种方法remove（Runnable）和purge（）来帮助回收存储。
 * <dt>Finalization</dt>
 *
 * <dd>A pool that is no longer referenced in a program <em>AND</em>
 * has no remaining threads will be {@code shutdown} automatically. If
 * you would like to ensure that unreferenced pools are reclaimed even
 * if users forget to call {@link #shutdown}, then you must arrange
 * that unused threads eventually die, by setting appropriate
 * keep-alive times, using a lower bound of zero core threads and/or
 * setting {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)}.  </dd>
 * 程序中不再引用且没有剩余线程的池将自动关闭。如果即使在用户忘记调用shutdown（）
 * 的情况下仍要确保收回未引用的池，则必须使用零核心线程的下限和/或通过设置适当的保持存活时间，
 * 安排未使用的线程最终死掉设置allowCoreThreadTimeOut（boolean）。
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p><b>Extension example</b>. Most extensions of this class
 * override one or more of the protected hook methods. For example,
 * here is a subclass that adds a simple pause/resume feature:
 * 此类的大多数扩展都覆盖一个或多个受保护的hook方法。例如，这是一个子类，它添加了一个简单的暂停/继续功能
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class PausableThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor {
 *   private boolean isPaused;
 *   private ReentrantLock pauseLock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   private Condition unpaused = pauseLock.newCondition();

     * The main pool control state, ctl, is an atomic integer packing
     * two conceptual fields
     *   workerCount, indicating the effective number of threads
     *   runState,    indicating whether running, shutting down etc
     * 主池控制状态ctl是一个打包两个概念字段workerCount的原子整数，指示线程的有效数量runState，指示是否运行，关闭等。
     *
     * In order to pack them into one int, we limit workerCount to
     * (2^29)-1 (about 500 million) threads rather than (2^31)-1 (2
     * billion) otherwise representable. If this is ever an issue in
     * the future, the variable can be changed to be an AtomicLong,
     * and the shift/mask constants below adjusted. But until the need
     * arises, this code is a bit faster and simpler using an int.
     * 为了将它们打包为一个int，我们将workerCount限制为（2 ^ 29）-1（大约5亿）个线程，而不是（2 ^ 31）-1（20亿）可以表示的线程。
     * 如果将来有问题，可以将该变量更改为AtomicLong，并在以下调整shift / mask常数。但是在需要之前，使用int可以使此代码更快，更简单。
     *
     * The workerCount is the number of workers that have been
     * permitted to start and not permitted to stop.  The value may be
     * transiently different from the actual number of live threads,
     * for example when a ThreadFactory fails to create a thread when
     * asked, and when exiting threads are still performing
     * bookkeeping before terminating. The user-visible pool size is
     * reported as the current size of the workers set.
     * workerCount是已被允许启动但不允许停止的工作线程数。该值可能与活动线程的实际数量暂时不同，
     * 例如，当ThreadFactory在被询问时未能创建线程，并且退出线程仍在终止之前执行簿记操作时，
     * 该值会有所不同。用户可见池大小报告为工作集的当前大小。
     * The runState provides the main lifecycle control, taking on values:
     *
     *   RUNNING:  Accept new tasks and process queued tasks
     *   SHUTDOWN: Don't accept new tasks, but process queued tasks
     *   STOP:     Don't accept new tasks, don't process queued tasks,
     *             and interrupt in-progress tasks
     *   TIDYING:  All tasks have terminated, workerCount is zero,
     *             the thread transitioning to state TIDYING
     *             will run the terminated() hook method
     *   TERMINATED: terminated() has completed
     *
     * The numerical order among these values matters, to allow
     * ordered comparisons. The runState monotonically increases over
     * time, but need not hit each state. The transitions are:
     * 这些值之间的数字顺序很重要，可以进行有序的比较。runState随时间单调增加，但不必达到每个状态。过渡是：
     * RUNNING -> SHUTDOWN
     *    On invocation of shutdown(), perhaps implicitly in finalize()
     * (RUNNING or SHUTDOWN) -> STOP
     *    On invocation of shutdownNow()
     * SHUTDOWN -> TIDYING
     *    When both queue and pool are empty
     * STOP -> TIDYING
     *    When pool is empty
     * TIDYING -> TERMINATED
     *    When the terminated() hook method has completed
     *
     * Threads waiting in awaitTermination() will return when the
     * state reaches TERMINATED.
     * 状态达到TERMINATED时，在awaitTermination（）中等待的线程将返回。
     *
     * Detecting the transition from SHUTDOWN to TIDYING is less
     * straightforward than you'd like because the queue may become
     * empty after non-empty and vice versa during SHUTDOWN state, but
     * we can only terminate if, after seeing that it is empty, we see
     * that workerCount is 0 (which sometimes entails a recheck -- see
     * below).
     * 检测从SHUTDOWN到TIDYING的转换并不像您想要的那样简单，因为在SHUTDOWN状态期间，
     * 队列在非空之后可能会变空，反之亦然，但是只有在看到它为空之后才能看到workerCount为0（有时需要重新检查-参见下文）。

     * 1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we
     * don't need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is
     * running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the
     * worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration
     * parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in
     * external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which
     * usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread.
     *
     * 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent
     * other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and then we
     * ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have
     * its interrupt set.
     *
     * 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which
     * might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die
     * (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing
     * the task.
     *
     * 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task,
     * gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute.
     * We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the
     * specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables.
     * Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we
     * wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's
     * UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also
     * conservatively causes thread to die.
     *
     * 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may
     * also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to
     * die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that
     * will be in effect even if task.run throws.
     *
     * The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute
     * and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate
     * information as we can provide about any problems encountered by
     * user code.
