/**
 * Factory and utility methods for {@link Executor}, {@link

 *此程序包中定义的Executor，ExecutorService，ScheduledExecutorService，ThreadFactory和Callable类的工厂和实用程序方法。此类支持以下方法：
 * Executor 工具类，
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Methods that create and return an {@link ExecutorService}
 *        set up with commonly useful configuration settings.
 *        使用通常有用的配置设置创建和返回ExecutorService的方法。
 *   <li> Methods that create and return a {@link ScheduledExecutorService}
 *        set up with commonly useful configuration settings.
 *        使用常用的配置设置创建并返回ScheduledExecutorService的方法。
 *   <li> Methods that create and return a "wrapped" ExecutorService, that
 *        disables reconfiguration by making implementation-specific methods
 *        inaccessible.
 *        创建并返回“包装的” ExecutorService的方法，该方法通过使特定于实现的方法不可访问来禁用重新配置。
 *        -- 禁止修改配置
 *   <li> Methods that create and return a {@link ThreadFactory}
 *        that sets newly created threads to a known state.
 *        创建并返回将新创建的线程设置为已知状态的ThreadFactory的方法。
 *   <li> Methods that create and return a {@link Callable}
 *        out of other closure-like forms, so they can be used
 *        in execution methods requiring {@code Callable}.
 *        从其他类似闭包的形式创建并返回Callable的方法，因此可以在需要Callable的执行方法中使用它们。
 * </ul>
