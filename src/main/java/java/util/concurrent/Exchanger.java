/**
 * A synchronization point at which threads can pair and swap elements
 * within pairs.  Each thread presents some object on entry to the
 * {@link #exchange exchange} method, matches with a partner thread,
 * and receives its partner's object on return.  An Exchanger may be
 * viewed as a bidirectional form of a {@link SynchronousQueue}.
 * Exchangers may be useful in applications such as genetic algorithms
 * and pipeline designs.
 * 线程可以配对并在配对内交换元素*的同步点。每个线程在进入* {@link #exchange exchange}方法时都会呈现一些对象，与一个伙伴线程匹配，并在返回时接收其伙伴的对象。可以将Exchanger视为{@link SynchronousQueue}的双向形式。 *交换器可能在遗传算法*和管道设计等应用中很有用
 * <p><b>Sample Usage:</b>
 * Here are the highlights of a class that uses an {@code Exchanger}
 * to swap buffers between threads so that the thread filling the
 * buffer gets a freshly emptied one when it needs it, handing off the
 * filled one to the thread emptying the buffer.

 * class FillAndEmpty {

    /*
     * Overview: The core algorithm is, for an exchange "slot",
     * and a participant (caller) with an item:
     *
     * for (;;) {
     *   if (slot is empty) {                       // offer 加入
     *     place item in a Node;
     *     if (can CAS slot from empty to node) {
     *       wait for release;
     *       return matching item in node;
     *     }
     *   }
     *   else if (can CAS slot from node to empty) { // release
     *     get the item in node;
     *     set matching item in node;
     *     release waiting thread;
     *   }
     *   // else retry on CAS failure
     * }
     * 双端队列数据结构
     * This is among the simplest forms of a "dual data structure" --
     * see Scott and Scherer's DISC 04 paper and
     * http://www.cs.rochester.edu/research/synchronization/pseudocode/duals.html
     *
     * This works great in principle. But in practice, like many
     * algorithms centered on atomic updates to a single location, it
     * scales horribly when there are more than a few participants
     * using the same Exchanger. So the implementation instead uses a
     * form of elimination arena, that spreads out this contention by
     * arranging that some threads typically use different slots,
     * while still ensuring that eventually, any two parties will be
     * able to exchange items. That is, we cannot completely partition
     * across threads, but instead give threads arena indices that
     * will on average grow under contention and shrink under lack of
     * contention. We approach this by defining the Nodes that we need
     * anyway as ThreadLocals, and include in them per-thread index
     * and related bookkeeping state. (We can safely reuse per-thread
     * nodes rather than creating them fresh each time because slots
     * alternate between pointing to a node vs null, so cannot
     * encounter ABA problems. However, we do need some care in
     * resetting them between uses.)
     *
     * Implementing an effective arena requires allocating a bunch of
     * space, so we only do so upon detecting contention (except on
     * uniprocessors, where they wouldn't help, so aren't used).
     * Otherwise, exchanges use the single-slot slotExchange method.
     * On contention, not only must the slots be in different
     * locations, but the locations must not encounter memory
     * contention due to being on the same cache line (or more
     * generally, the same coherence unit).  Because, as of this
     * writing, there is no way to determine cacheline size, we define
     * a value that is enough for common platforms.  Additionally,
     * extra care elsewhere is taken to avoid other false/unintended
     * sharing and to enhance locality, including adding padding (via
     * sun.misc.Contended) to Nodes, embedding "bound" as an Exchanger
     * field, and reworking some park/unpark mechanics compared to
     * LockSupport versions.
     *
     * The arena starts out with only one used slot. We expand the
     * effective arena size by tracking collisions; i.e., failed CASes
     * while trying to exchange. By nature of the above algorithm, the
     * only kinds of collision that reliably indicate contention are
     * when two attempted releases collide -- one of two attempted
     * offers can legitimately fail to CAS without indicating
     * contention by more than one other thread. (Note: it is possible
     * but not worthwhile to more precisely detect contention by
     * reading slot values after CAS failures.)  When a thread has
     * collided at each slot within the current arena bound, it tries
     * to expand the arena size by one. We track collisions within
     * bounds by using a version (sequence) number on the "bound"
     * field, and conservatively reset collision counts when a
     * participant notices that bound has been updated (in either
     * direction).
     *
     * The effective arena size is reduced (when there is more than
     * one slot) by giving up on waiting after a while and trying to
     * decrement the arena size on expiration. The value of "a while"
     * is an empirical matter.  We implement by piggybacking on the
     * use of spin->yield->block that is essential for reasonable
     * waiting performance anyway -- in a busy exchanger, offers are
     * usually almost immediately released, in which case context
     * switching on multiprocessors is extremely slow/wasteful.  Arena
     * waits just omit the blocking part, and instead cancel. The spin
     * count is empirically chosen to be a value that avoids blocking
     * 99% of the time under maximum sustained exchange rates on a
     * range of test machines. Spins and yields entail some limited
     * randomness (using a cheap xorshift) to avoid regular patterns
     * that can induce unproductive grow/shrink cycles. (Using a
     * pseudorandom also helps regularize spin cycle duration by
     * making branches unpredictable.)  Also, during an offer, a
     * waiter can "know" that it will be released when its slot has
     * changed, but cannot yet proceed until match is set.  In the
     * mean time it cannot cancel the offer, so instead spins/yields.
     * Note: It is possible to avoid this secondary check by changing
     * the linearization point to be a CAS of the match field (as done
     * in one case in the Scott & Scherer DISC paper), which also
     * increases asynchrony a bit, at the expense of poorer collision
     * detection and inability to always reuse per-thread nodes. So
     * the current scheme is typically a better tradeoff.
     *
     * On collisions, indices traverse the arena cyclically in reverse
     * order, restarting at the maximum index (which will tend to be
     * sparsest) when bounds change. (On expirations, indices instead
     * are halved until reaching 0.) It is possible (and has been
     * tried) to use randomized, prime-value-stepped, or double-hash
     * style traversal instead of simple cyclic traversal to reduce
     * bunching.  But empirically, whatever benefits these may have
     * don't overcome their added overhead: We are managing operations
     * that occur very quickly unless there is sustained contention,
     * so simpler/faster control policies work better than more
     * accurate but slower ones.
     *
     * Because we use expiration for arena size control, we cannot
     * throw TimeoutExceptions in the timed version of the public
     * exchange method until the arena size has shrunken to zero (or
     * the arena isn't enabled). This may delay response to timeout
     * but is still within spec.
     *
     * Essentially all of the implementation is in methods
     * slotExchange and arenaExchange. These have similar overall
     * structure, but differ in too many details to combine. The
     * slotExchange method uses the single Exchanger field "slot"
     * rather than arena array elements. However, it still needs
     * minimal collision detection to trigger arena construction.
     * (The messiest part is making sure interrupt status and
     * InterruptedExceptions come out right during transitions when
     * both methods may be called. This is done by using null return
     * as a sentinel to recheck interrupt status.)
     *
     * As is too common in this sort of code, methods are monolithic
     * because most of the logic relies on reads of fields that are
     * maintained as local variables so can't be nicely factored --
     * mainly, here, bulky spin->yield->block/cancel code), and
     * heavily dependent on intrinsics (Unsafe) to use inlined
     * embedded CAS and related memory access operations (that tend
     * not to be as readily inlined by dynamic compilers when they are
     * hidden behind other methods that would more nicely name and
     * encapsulate the intended effects). This includes the use of
     * putOrderedX to clear fields of the per-thread Nodes between
     * uses. Note that field Node.item is not declared as volatile
     * even though it is read by releasing threads, because they only
     * do so after CAS operations that must precede access, and all
     * uses by the owning thread are otherwise acceptably ordered by
     * other operations. (Because the actual points of atomicity are
     * slot CASes, it would also be legal for the write to Node.match
     * in a release to be weaker than a full volatile write. However,
     * this is not done because it could allow further postponement of
     * the write, delaying progress.)
