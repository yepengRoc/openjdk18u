/**
 * 此类提供了一些Queue操作的基本实现。当基本实现不允许空元素时，此类中的实现是合适的。
 * 方法add，remove和element分别基于offer，poll和peek，但是抛出异常而不是通过false或null返回指示失败。
 *
 * <p>扩展此类的Queue实现必须最少定义一个不允许插入空元素的Queue.offer（E）方法，
 * 以及Queue.peek（），Queue.poll（），Collection.size（）和Collection方法.iterator（）。
 * 通常，其他方法也会被覆盖。如果不能满足这些要求，请考虑将AbstractCollection子类化。
