 * that object and all weak references to any other weakly-reachable objects

 * references.  At the same time it will declare all of the formerly

 * registered with reference queues.
 * 假设垃圾收集器在某个时间点确定对象是弱可访问的。到那时，它将自动清除对该对象的所有弱引用，
 * 以及对所有其他弱可达对象的弱引用，这些对象都可以通过一系列强引用和软引用从该对象到达。同时，
 * 它将声明所有以前弱可及的对象都是可终结的。同时或稍后，它将把那些新近清除的弱引用加入队列，这些弱引用已在引用队列中注册。
